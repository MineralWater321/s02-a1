My motivation in joining the bootcamp is career change. I feel that my current job is going to a dead end. I have always pushed back learning how to code so I might as well do it now.

I currently work as a machine translator for chinese novels and I have been doing so for 3 years. I'm also a fresh graduate of BS Electronics Engineering.
